# INAV X-Plane HITL plugin

**Hardware-in-the-loop** plugin for **X-Plane 11 & 12** for **INAV Flight Controller firmware**:

**Hardware-in-the-loop (HITL) simulation**, is a technique that is used in the development and testing of complex real-time embedded systems. 

**X-Plane** is a flight simulation engine series developed and published by Laminar Research https://www.x-plane.com/

**INAV-X-Plane-HITL** is plugin for **X-Plane** for testing and developing **INAV flight controller firmware** https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav.


# Motivation

I believe that good testing and debugging tools are key points to achieve software stability.

It is not Ok when people debug autopilot by running with RC Plane on the field :smiley:

I hope this plugin can help to improve INAV firmware.

While not been a main purpose, plugin can be used to improve pilot skils or getting familiar with INAV settings.

# How it works

![](doc/x-plane-logo.png) 

**X-Plane** https://www.x-plane.com/ is flight simulator with accurate physics simulation. 
 
X-Plane is extendable with plugins. This plugin connects to Flight Controller through USB cable and passes gyroscope, accelerometer, barometer, magnethometer, GPS and Pitot tube data from X-Plane, which replace data from physical sensors. 

FC sends back **yaw/pitch/roll** controls which are passed to X-Plane.

## X-Plane 11 or X-Plane 12?

Simulation requires at least 50, or even better 100, solid FPS without freezing. 

While **X-Plane 12** has better visual appearance, **X-Plane 11** is still recommented choice due to better performance.
